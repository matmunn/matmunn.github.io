So it's been a while since I've written here. Since that time I've discharged from the Army and moved to Melbourne where I am now employed as a web developer at Savi Communications. I've really enjoyed the transition and have rediscovered my passion for writing code, instead of slugging it out in a job that I wasn't fully satisfied with. I definitely miss the military, but not all aspects were so terrific. I really look forward to going to work now.

I'll post about some more of my adventures soon.

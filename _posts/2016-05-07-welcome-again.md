title: Welcome! (again)

**Welcome to my new and (mostly) improved website!**

I've had my site offline for a while now, I haven't needed to have it up due to focusing on my actual day job, but now, after six years, I'm starting to look at discharging from the Australian Army. So I figure now is as good a time as ever to get back into the swing of things.

I hope to use this site as a bit of a place where I can post a collection of my thoughts, showcase some of my work and have a bit of a presence.

You'll be hearing from me soon.

-- Mat.

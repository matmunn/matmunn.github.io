title: January (and Feb) Update
---

So here it is, my first update for 2017. I know it comes over a full month into the year and I wish I could say I've been super busy but then I'd be a liar.

I managed to spent Christmas with my family, which was nice. It's been a while since I've been able to get home with them for a Christmas period. I've been lucky that my parents were willing to travel around the country to see me while I was serving. After spending a few days sorting out all their IT issues I managed to get back home and rest for a few days before heading back to work.

Work had a quiet start to the year, which has been a pretty nice way to ease back in to the year ahead. I've spent most of my time working on a large internal project that we started last year. At the time it was based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) 5.2, so earlier this year I brought it up to 5.3 and then just last week up to the newly released 5.4.

The system is pretty important within the work we do and it's come a long way since its initial conception. It was originally meant to be a replacement for an existing system we have, but it's taken on a life of its own and gone even further. It's been a fun project to spend a lot of time back on Laravel after mainly focusing on frontend dev for most of the last 6 months.

Speaking of 6 months, it's now been six months that I've been working at [Savi](http://www.savi.com.au) now. The time has absolutely flown and I have no idea where it's gone. I still miss the army, I miss a lot of it, and I still get asked about it. But I do know that I left for a reason and if I went back to it I'd more than likely regret it. I've been given a great opportunity and I'm going to make the most out of it.

So this is my update for now. I'd like to say I'll be more active on the update front, but once again I'd be a liar. I'll do my best though.

Until next time,

Mat.
